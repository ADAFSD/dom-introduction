# Instructions
1. Import your script.js file to your index.html file
2. Create a quick html page with some variation of at least 3 of these elements from the list: 
    * h1 Header
    * table with 3 rows of content
    * an unordered list with 3 list items
    * an ordered list with 3 list items
    * a paragraph with at least 3 sentences
3. Give these elements IDs in the html page for future styling.
4. Use document.getElementByID("element-id"); to grab the element's id.
5. Style each element by color, size, shape, as you see fit. You must style at least 3 elements.

## Hints
1. Remember there is more to styling than text color. You can use fontsize, background color, fontweight, etc.
