# The Document Object Model
For this introductory session, you will be actively using DOM Manipulation.
You will use methods such as 
* getElementById()
* getElementsByClass()
* querySelector()
* querySelectorAll()
to grab elements from your existing html page.

You will change style and attributes using your grabbed elements using
* style properties
* setAttribute() methods

You are provided finished demos along with practice problems to help solidify some of the basic DOM concepts.
