# Instructions
1. Import your script.js file to your html file, so you can see all the magic happen!
2. Create multiple elements with class names and ids. You are required to have these elements at minimum:
    * image
    * div
    * h1 (Header)
    * a table with 2 columns and 2 rows
3. Use the querySelectorAll(), querySelector(), getElementById(), and/or getElementsByClass() methods to grab elements from the html page into your script.js file.
4. Style and manipulate your elements by using the .setAttribute() method for each element in your html file.
